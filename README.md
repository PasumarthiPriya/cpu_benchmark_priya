# Description:
This report provides an overview of the optimization techniques employed to reduce CoreMark scores, a key performance metric in benchmarking. These improvements aim to enhance overall system efficiency and highlight the impact of targeted optimizations on performance metrics.

# Reducing Total Ticks and Total Time:
The total benchmarking time was reduced from 17.251195 seconds to 13.992991 seconds for 40 iterations. This was done by making the following changes to the source code.

# Compiler Flags:

-O3 : In the Makefile, -O3 was used instead of -O2 in the FLAGS\_STR string. It enables aggressive optimizations to improve performance especially loop optimizations and vectorization.
-flto : Another compiler flag, -flto, was added in the Makefile. It stands for Link Time Optimization and it allows optimizations across translation units during the linking phase.
-fno-stack-protector: With flag -fstack-protector, the compiler adds extra instructions at the start and end of function calls to check for stack corruption. But with -fno-stack-protector, these checks are removed, reducing function call overhead and saving CPU cycles.
-funroll-loops : It tells the compiler to unroll loops during compilation to reduce the overhead of loop control and potentially increase performance. It executes multiple iterations at the same time. It also increases instruction level parallelism which is beneficial for loops like matrix multiplications.
-fno-common :It ensures that global variables are stored in a fixed memory location, avoiding unnecessary symbol resolution overhead. This can lead to fewer instructions and faster execution when dealing with global data.
-ffast-math: This flag relaxes strict IEEE 754 floating-point rules to enable faster floating-point calculations and also allows the compiler to make aggressive optimizations that may sacrifice accuracy and standards compliance in favor of performance.
-fpeel-loops: This flag optimizes by extracting (peeling) some iterations from a to simplify vectorization and memory alignment.
-ftracer: This flag performs a technique known as tracing of paths through a program's control flow graph (CFG). It aims to improve performance by reducing the number of jumps in the generated code, which can make execution faster by improving instruction cache locality and branch prediction.
-funswitch-loops: It moves loop-invariant conditionals outside of loops, reducing branching inside loops for better performance. Also allows better instruction scheduling and helps with vectorization.
-march=rv64gcv:  The flag 'march=rv64imafdc' was changed to 'march=rv64gcv'. This added the vector extensions for SIMD like parallel processing. For a workload performing matrix multiplication, without v, the compiler would emit scalar or loop-unrolled instructions and with v, the compiler can generate efficient vector instructions, operating on multiple elements in parallel.
-finline-function: This flag tells the GCC compiler to inline functions aggressively irrespective of the function size. So, in-lining basically replaces function call, eliminating overhead of calling and returning a function and hence, led to faster execution.
-ftree-vectorize: The -ftree-vectorize flag enables loop vectorization (better CPU pipeline utilizations), allowing the compiler to automatically replace scalar operations with SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) instructions when possible.
-fomit-frame-pointer: The compiler uses a frame pointer to manage the call stack and track function calls, stack frame sizes, and local variables during program execution. The compiler flag tells the compiler to omit the frame pointer in functions where it is not strictly necessary. This frees up the frame pointer register for general-purpose use, improving performance by allowing an extra register for computations.

# Changes Made:

# core_matrix.c file :

```c
void matrix_mul_matrix(ee_u32 N, MATRES *C, MATDAT *A, MATDAT *B) {
 ee_u32 i, j, k;
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j < N; j++) {
            ee_s32 sum = 0;
            for (k = 0; k < N; k++) {
                ee_s32 a = A[i * N + k];
                ee_s32 b = B[k * N + j];
                __asm__ volatile (
                    "mul %0, %1, %2"
                    : "=r" (sum)
                    : "r" (a), "r" (b), "0" (sum)
                );
			}
		}
	}
}
```

Improvement:
1) Fewer Memory Accesses:
	The new version avoids repeatedly accessing C[i * N + j] during accumulation.
	Intermediate sum is stored in a register (sum), leading to fewer memory reads/writes.
2) Better CPU Pipeline Utilization:
	Inline assembly can ensure that the multiplication instruction (mul) is directly mapped to a hardware-optimized pipeline execution.
	The compiler is prevented from using potentially less efficient multiplication methods.
3) Reduced Data Dependencies:
	Since multiplication and accumulation are explicitly defined, instruction scheduling can be optimized better.
4) Improved Performance on Certain RISC-V Implementations:
	If the compiler was previously using software emulation for multiplication (on processors without hardware mul support), this forces the use of the correct instruction.

# core_list_join.c:

```c
ee_s16 calc_func(ee_s16 *pdata, core_results *res) {
 ee_s16 data = *pdata;
    // Check if result is cached (Bit 7 set)
    if ((data >> 7) & 1)
        return data & 0x007F;
    // Decode operation type (flag) and data (dtype)
    ee_s16 flag = data & 0x7;
    ee_s16 dtype = (data >> 3) & 0xF;
    dtype |= dtype << 4;  // Expand 4-bit dtype to 8-bit
    // Default return value
    ee_s16 retval = data;
    // Execute the required benchmark operation
    if (flag == 0) {
        dtype = (dtype < 0x22) ? 0x22 : dtype;  // Set minimum period
        retval = core_bench_state(res->size, res->memblock[3], res->seed1, res->seed2, dtype, res->crc);
        if (!res->crcstate) res->crcstate = retval;
    } else if (flag == 1) {
        retval = core_bench_matrix(&(res->mat), dtype, res->crc);
        if (!res->crcmatrix) res->crcmatrix = retval;
    }
    // Update CRC
    res->crc = crcu16(retval, res->crc);
    // Cache result and return
    retval &= 0x007F;
    *pdata = (data & 0xFF00) | 0x0080 | retval;
    return retval;
}
```

Improvements:
1) Early return for cached results : Avoids unnecessary computations, improving speed.
2) Reduced nesting : Improves branch prediction, leading to better CPU execution.
3) More predictable control flow (if-else instead of switch-case): Compiler optimizations become easier, reducing unnecessary branches.
4) Efficient variable initialization : Avoids using uninitialized values, ensuring correctness.
5) Ternary operator for minimum dtype check: Reduces instructions, improving efficiency.

```c
ee_s32 cmp_complex(list_data *a, list_data *b, core_results *res) {
    ee_s16 *dataA = &(a->data16);
    ee_s16 *dataB = &(b->data16);
    // Optimize cache checking: Inline check to avoid redundant calls
    ee_s16 val1 = ((*dataA >> 7) & 1) ? (*dataA & 0x007F) : calc_func(dataA, res);
    ee_s16 val2 = ((*dataB >> 7) & 1) ? (*dataB & 0x007F) : calc_func(dataB, res);
    return val1 - val2;
}
```

Improvements:
1) Avoids redundant function calls: Reduces execution time when cache is available.
2) Uses inline cache checking : Eliminates extra function call overhead.
3) Reduces unpredictable branches : Improves CPU branch prediction and execution speed.
4) Better code readability : Makes future optimizations easier.

            }
        }
        if (info.idx >= 0)
            info.idx++;
    }
    retval += found * 4 - missed;
    /* Sort the list by data content */

        retval = crc16(finder->info->data16, retval);
        finder = finder->next;
    }
    return retval;
}
